            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p class="lead">As a part of Invento’18, the multifest of GEC Palakkad, IEEE SB of the college organized ‘Open GEC’ for school students where they got an opportunity to get introduced to the world of engineering. The event took place at IT seminar hall on 26th February, 2018  with a parked hall and anxious audience. The event began with an interactive session between SB Counselor, Dr. Vinita Chellappan and school students. Her thoughtful views and years of experience inspired many students. Then the stage was taken over by the students of GEC Palakkad to give them an introduction about Engineering and and an interactive ice breaking session was held for the students. After the session, the students were taken to to different engineering labs. The afternoon period comprised of Project expo, puzzles and quiz where the students were excited and enthusiastic in answering and asking questions. They were even introduced to Robotics.  The event ended with a lot of memories caught on camera, with school students and IEEE volunteers.:</p>
